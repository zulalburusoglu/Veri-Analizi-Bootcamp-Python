Airline Passenger Satisfaction Data Analysis
This project explores a large dataset of airline passenger satisfaction to uncover insights and patterns that impact customer experiences. With over 100,000 entries and 28 features, the analysis provides a comprehensive statistical and visual breakdown of various factors affecting satisfaction, such as service quality, flight distance, delays, and passenger demographics.

Missing values in "Arrival Delay in Minutes" were imputed with 0 due to their low proportion (0.29%).
Outliers were identified in several features but retained to preserve data integrity.
Detailed summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) were generated for numerical attributes to understand the data distribution.
Various factors affecting satisfaction, such as service quality, flight distance, delays, and passenger demographics were visualized with different plots.
